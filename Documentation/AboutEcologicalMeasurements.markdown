Ecological measurements are divers, and mostly not a goal, but a means. A means to produce a spreadsheet, display a map,
analyse what happens to a species in time, analyse the quality of a body of water, required reporting to the government, etc.
To be able to provide relevant information, the following is stored with a measurement:

| Topic | Description |
| --- | -- |
| Who | What organisation requested the measurement and/or performed the sampling/analysis. |
| When | When the sample was taken, the analysis performed. Ecological measurements are mostly non-automated and non-continuous. |
| Where | Where the measurement was taken. This includes a position, but also what compartment such as open water, shore, vegetation. Some measurements are taken on a boat, so the position of the measurement may not be fixed and can differ from the location where the measurement object. |
| What | This can range from a single chemical, to multiple kinds of species per measurement. Next to the parameter (mostly applies to species), more specifications might be requested, such as life stage, gender, behaviour. |
| Why | The reason why the measurement took place. Was it, for instance, for a regular monitoring, was it for a specific project, was it for assessments, etc. |
| How | The how described how a sample was taken, for instance: what fish net was used, what size the holes in the net were, what handbook was used to sample, or to analyse, etc. |

To allow those questions to be answered, the information required to answer those questions, need to be stored. That makes ecological measurements more complex, since that meta-information varies.
